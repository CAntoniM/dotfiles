# DOTFILES

this is a collection of configuration files used by my linux hosts collected
into one repo (with some submodules (yes i know they are bad)). the reason for
doing this is to help with unifying configuration across platforms 

This repo is to be installed into either

- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`:  on linux
- `%LocalAppData`: on windows

This configuration is meant to contain only to contain the subset of
configuration of a subset of important non security ciritical applications e.g.
git, svn, fish, nvim, alactritty. 

and never should it contains security ciritical files e.g. ssh, gnupg. etc
